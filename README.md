# 📸 Snapplot

**Snapplot** is a real-time social scavenger hunt that turns your physical surroundings into a chaotic, AI-generated story. Built for nwHacks 2026, it bridges the gap between digital gaming and real-world interaction.

## 🚀 Inspiration
We wanted to bring the game back to reality. Instead of staring at screens, Snapplot forces players to look up, run around, and interact with the world to solve creative prompts.

## ✨ Features
- **Real-Time Multiplayer:** Instant synchronization using Socket.io (WebSocket).
- **Live Camera Scavenger Hunt:** Snap photos of objects matching the prompt (e.g., "Something round that tells time but isn't a clock").
- **Synchronized Reveals:** Dramatic, drum-roll-induced result screens where everyone sees the winner at the exact same moment.
- **AI Story Generation:** At the end of the game, your chaotic photos are stitched together into a cohesive narrative using GenAI.
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs smoothly on iOS and Android via Expo.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo), TypeScript, NativeWind (TailwindCSS)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Socket.io
- **AI:** Gemini and OpenRouter API for story generation.
- **Image Processing:** Sharp (server-side image rotation and compression).
